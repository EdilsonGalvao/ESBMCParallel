# ESBMC Parallel

ESBMC is a context-bounded model checker for embedded C/C++ software based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver. It allows the verification engineer (i) to verify single- and multi-threaded software (with shared variables and locks); (ii) to reason about arithmetic under- and overflow, pointer safety, memory leaks, array bounds, atomicity and order violations, deadlock and data race; (iii) to verify programs that make use of bit-level, pointers, structs, unions and fixed-point arithmetic.

ESBMC uses the SMT solvers Z3 (default) and Boolector, which are also included in the distribution. The restrictions of the Z3, Boolector and CProver licenses apply.

ESBMC is a joint project with the University of Southampton, University of Stellenbosch, and Federal University of Amazonas.
